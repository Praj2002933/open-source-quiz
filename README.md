# open-source-quiz
As it is the era of open source, nowadays everyone wants to contribute to open source. So, first of all, they should be aware of like what exactly is open source. So, I thought of creating a webpage of 10 questions that best describes the stuff related to open source. Even, if it is a basic quiz, I think it will definitely add some value to your open-source knowledge.
Checks your knowledge regarding open source like what you know till now and how are you updating yourself in the open source community.
I have used HTML and CSS to build it on replit platform which again is also open-source software. First I built a blueprint of the page like how it should look using Figma and then implemented it.
Writing code was a little bit time-consuming as we have to make questions along with four options.
Actually, it's my first project I would say which was related to the front end, in earlier days I have only tried implementing the design using Figma software and was not implemented it. So, yeah I am happy that I built something which could add knowledge to others.
First of all, I learned how to use replit open-source software. Also, learned how to build  HTML pages and style them using Cascaded Style Sheets(CSS) 
I can add some more questions to it and publish it as a website which can be helpful to students to check the knowledge that they have acquired in this community or field.
